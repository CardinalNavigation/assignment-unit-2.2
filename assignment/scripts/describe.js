// WHAT IS THIS EVEN DOING?

// For questions 1-3, each code block is syntactically and logically correct. Your job is to describe what is happening. 
// They are in isolation -- variables in one question do not affect other questions.
// Describe the code as it would be run, and make sure you give us the console.log's value at the end.
// (Don't just say 'we console log the variable' -- instead say something like 'we console log 'yes'')


// 0. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// //EXAMPLE. We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 2 is equal to 2, so
// we console.log 'yes'.

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

number++;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/


// 1. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// The first line of code sets a value of "Dane" to the variable "name"
// The second line of code creates a condition that uses the operator "===" 
// which will check the strings to assess if they are exactly the same.
// "Dane" and "Mary" are not the same string value so we move to the else condition
// the console.log, will then produce the words "How do you do?" since the if condition was not met


//CODE
/*
let name = 'Dane';

if (name === 'Mary') {
  console.log('Hi, Mary!');
} else {
  console.log('How do you do?');
}


*/

// 2. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// The code creates a variable "secret" without a value, the sets the value of variable "code" to the number "123".
// the first if condition says if Code is exacly "123", then the variable secret gets labeled 'super
// and the variable code is mutiplied by 2, which means the code is 246
// the next if condition checks whether "code" which is now 246, is greater than 250
// if it was, it would change the variable secret to "duper" but since 246 is not greater than
// 250, when the console log is run it reports "super" 

//CODE
/*
let secret;

let code = 123;

if(code === 123) {
  secret = 'super';
  code = code * 2;
}

if (code > 250) {
  secret = 'duper'
}

console.log(secret)

*/

// 3. WRITE YOUR DESCRIPTION HERE
// Alright so there are 3 defined variables.
// isStudent is a boolean value true, age is the number "34" zip is the number 55407
// The condition presented assesses whether isStudent is exactly (===) true AND (&&) if the Zip is greater than 8000
// at the same time. The answer is that it is not given the assigned values, so on to the next conditional.
// The next else if checks if the boolean value of isStudent is "false" OR if the variable age is less than 30. 
// The variable is NOT false, and the age is greater than 30, so we drop down to the next conditional.
// the next else if assesses if isStudent is true, which it is, which means the console log will run "Welcome to Prime"
// The last line will not run since the else is dependent on the line above "failing"

//CODE
/*
let isStudent = true;
let age = 34;
let zip = 55407;

if (isStudent === true && zip > 80000 ) {
  console.log(`You're a student on the West Coast!`);
} else if (isStudent === false || age < 30) {
  console.log('What are your hobbies?');
} else if (isStudent === true) {
  console.log('Welcome to Prime!');
} else {
  console.log('How about the weather?')
}

// REVERSE
// Now, for questions 4-6, we'll give you a description and some code. 
// Some of the code will NOT match the description.
// Comment above the problem code, and describe a potential solution.
// Look closely -- things are logically incorrect or missing and wrong in the code!

// EXAMPLE
// 0. (DESCRIPTION OF CORRECT BEHAVIOR)
// We make a variable called number and set it to 1 as a number.
// Then we increment the number variable. Number is now 2.
// We check if number is greater than or equal to 2. 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'yes'

//CODE
/*
let number = 1;

// FIX - number-- decrements number, but the instructions ask to increment.
// Should be number++.
number--;

if (number >= 2) {
  console.log('yes');
}

*/



//4. We start with three variables -- colorOne is set to 'blue' and 
// colorTwo is set to 'red', and mix is set to true. We check if mix is true 
// -- it is, so we set colorOne and colorTwo to 'purple'

/*
let colorOne = 'red';
let colorTwo = 'blue';
let mix = true;

if (mix === true) {
  colorOne = 'purple';
}
*/

//5. We start with two variables -- temp is set to 40 and time is set to 4.
// We check if temp is higher than 39 and if time is greater or equal to  4 
// -- they are so we console.log 'throw away the food!'

/*
let temp = 40;
const time = 4;

if (temp > 39 || time >= 4) {
  console.log('throw away the food!');
}
*/

//6. We start with two variables -- age is set to 21 and minAge is set to 21.
// We check if age is greater than or equal to minAge 
// -- it is, so we console.log 'enter'.

/*
let age = 21;
const minAge = 21;

if(minAge <= age) {
  console.log('no entry');
